            Egypt is a country in the North Eastern corner of Africa. It covers an area of 386,660 square miles. Most of the country is covered by the Sahara and Libyan deserts. Interestingly, Egypt is home to the worldâ€™s longest river, the river Nile. The country is composed of a variety of ecological regions. Some of the ecological regions are Dry Sahel, Nile Delta, Levantine Sea, Sahara Desert, the Red Sea coastal desert and Mediterranean dry woodlands.

            Levantine Sea ecological region is a marine biome and is the area that is Eastern most of the Mediterranean Sea. The Suez Canal which was completed in 1869 links the Levantine Sea to the Red Sea. Due to the higher elevation of the Red Sea compared to the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, water from the Red Sea pours into the Mediterranean Sea. For decades, plants and animals in the Red sea could not migrate to the Levantine Sea due to the very saline Bitter lakes that form part of the canal. However, as water flowed from the Red Sea to the Levantine Sea, the salinity of the water was neutralized. Plants and animals began to move from the Red Sea and into the Levantine Sea. River Nile brought freshwater and silt into the Levantine Sea and enabled the existence of Sardines in the area. When Aswan dam was constructed along the Nile, the flow of freshwater and silt into the Levantine Sea drastically dropped and led to the decline in sardine population. Consequently, the important sardine fisheries collapsed.
